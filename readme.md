# Just a face detection experiment...

This experiment explores the close relationship between humans and chimps - it uses a simple open source face detection algorithm to overlay a chimp face on to pictures of humans.

Source code is available under MS-PL on github (which is similar to Creative Commons, just offers me a little more protection in case anyone wants to run a nuclear power station using my chimp...)

I am currently trying to see if I can take this experiment further - maybe using more monkey photos with Jersey Zoo or with Monkey World, or maybe using some branding from the most famous of humanzees - http://projectoliver.com/

Is it art? is it science? is it just fun?

A YouTube video will be up soon... in the next few days
